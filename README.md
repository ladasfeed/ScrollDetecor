# ScrollDetecor

Hello everyone. This is small react plugin to visualize current section on your website. It is very simple to use and customize. There is no any dependecies.
In repository you can see source folder and example folder. 
Just copy source folder to your project and follow the example:

      <ScrollDetector>
          <section className="section_1"/>
          <section className="section_2"/>
          <section className="section_3"/>
          <section className="section_4"/>
      </ScrollDetector>
      
As you can see, you may just wrap sections on website page. To customize ScrollDetector go to source folder and write css code in file custom-style.css â€” there is 3 classes:
1 for wrapper, 1 for inactive element-detector, 1 for active element-detector.

That is all. Good luck and keep your code simpler!
